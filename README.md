# Color Code Viewer

A user-friendly web application to view and interact with color codes. The app allows you to input Hex color codes, dynamically adjust color using sliders for Red, Green, and Blue values, and get suggestions for valid color codes if the input is incorrect. Additionally, it includes a color example panel that can be toggled to explore popular color combinations.
